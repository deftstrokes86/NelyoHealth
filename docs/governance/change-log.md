# NelyoHealth Phase 0 Change Log

## 2026-06-23

### Entry 001 — Baseline planning shell created (P00-00)
- Added repository preflight + governance artifacts:
  - `docs/STATUS.md`
  - `docs/exec-plans/P00-product-clinical-regulatory-foundation.md`
  - `docs/governance/document-register.md`
  - `docs/governance/decision-register.md`
  - `docs/governance/open-questions.md`
  - `docs/governance/assumptions-register.md`
  - `docs/governance/traceability-conventions.md`
- Captured all locked phase-0 requirements as approved base decisions.
- Mapped `P00-01` through `P00-17` into execution order.
- Logged source-precedence and unresolved external questions.
- Confirmed no committed implementation code exists in the repo before planning baseline.
- Added explicit conflict markers:
  - build-map bootstrap/dependency recommendations that conflict with current phase-0 constraints.
  - numbering mismatch handling between complete breakdown and prompt pack.

### Opened by
- Execution lead for NelyoHealth planning
- No external approvers were required to create this baseline, but several approvals remain pending.

### Change intent
- Preserve locked safety rules.
- Keep Phase 0 documentation-only and prepare stable handoff artifacts for external review.

### Risk notes
- This baseline is blocked for full implementation by unresolved legal and clinical questions listed in `docs/governance/open-questions.md`.
